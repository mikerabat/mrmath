= Linear Algebra =

Most of the linear algebra functionality are a direct conversion from the numerical recipies in C book (second edition) - so their basics are quite simple and can be looked up there. The routins translated from there 
are:

  * Singular Value decomposition
  * QR Decomposition
  * Cholesky Decomposition
  * Gauss Jordan elimination (though not exposed in the matrix class)

Since these original algorithms are not cache oblivious the performance may not be as good as in the simple matrix operations.

An exception here is the LU decomposition which is based on the recursive implementation of the standard LU decomp. 

In the library itself the matrix inversion and matrix determinant calculation are based on the LU decomposition.
